# Stella

## What is Stella?

Stella is a simple customer management for small businesses. The idea came from the necessity by a specific store to manage its customers in a simple way, giving up on the hundreds of papers and archives that were at the store.

It is currently available in English and Portuguese.

## How to use?

Once you have your application, you can start adding customers and services, loading their accounts with pre-paid services and charge them, or do a one-time purchase during the charging process.

The idea of loading services is for the customers to be able to load RFID business cards with pre-paid services and redeem them at the store.

## TODO

- RFID card integration
- WooCommerce plugin for purchasing services online (and redeem at the store)
